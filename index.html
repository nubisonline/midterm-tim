					<h1>Questions</h1>

					<ul>
						<li>Do closed teams experience the same frustrations w.r.t. communication (tools) as open teams?</li>
						<li>Is frequent communication before and after work essential for productive development in closed teams?</li><!-- TODO -->
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						End goal is to improve productivity by making better communication tools.

						Existing work in communication of open teams, we would like to apply that.
						Once we have that, we want to know if communication is actually important for productivity.

						If both yes, we can use existing results.
						If we get a no, we can focus on the differences to make changes.

					<h1>Differences with open teams</h1>

					<aside class="notes">
						While there aren't a lot of studies dealing with closed virtual teams (their occurence is relatively new),
						there's more studies about open teams.

						We would like to be able to use those results, so we're going to look at the differences, and hopefully
						similarity between open and closed teams.

						So, to answer the question Do closed teams experience the same frustrations w.r.t. communication (tools) as open teams?, we looked at two existing studies.

					<h1>Hanging out</h1>

					<aside class="notes">
						28 responses, 86% developer responses.
						Everyone is using Hangouts, always.
						People like it because it's faster than email, mostly positive about IM itself.

						Slack seems more of a social hub, news/info aggr.
						Customer support.

						Too noisy, chats while not working, client issues (images/videos).

						Fun.

						Alexey, thanks.

						One of contributions is challenges.
						Miscommunication text-based, people in general are a challenge.

						Sub-summary.
						Over the whole, it seems like the challenges facing these two types of teams are quite similar.

						Different use case.
						Slack survey use as personal stuff, news, etc.
						While full business focus (though some people use it for personal).
